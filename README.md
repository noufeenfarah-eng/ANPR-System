A Computer Vision–based **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system built using **YOLOv8, OpenCV, and EasyOCR** to detect and extract vehicle registration numbers from images and webcam input.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project detects vehicle number plates using a trained **YOLOv8 license plate detector** and extracts plate text using **EasyOCR**. It supports:

* 🖼️ Single image recognition
* 📁 Folder batch processing
* 🎥 Real-time webcam detection
* 📝 CSV logging of detected plates

The system also includes OCR text cleaning to improve number plate accuracy.
